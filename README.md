# Snakes-and-Ladders-Game
Produced an ancient board game as my first web development project using HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript.

## Project Brief
### MVP - Minimal Viable Product
* Build a working game using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery
* Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
* Hosted on GitHub pages
* Display game on browser
* Game includes user interaction

## Time Frame
1 week

## Description
Snakes and Ladders is a worldwide classic board game originated in ancient India.  It is played on a game board with numbered, gridded squares. A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped by climbing ladders but hindered by falling down snakes.
The historic version had its roots in morality lessons, on which a player's progression up the board represented a life journey complicated by virtues (ladders) and vices (snakes).

## Deployment
Access to play the game is here: https://snakes-and-ladders-game.vercel.app/

## How to Play
The game is hosted as a 1 player game with starting position on game board at 1. On every roll of dice the player moves up to reach the goal of 100 to WIN the game, while going through the ups and downs of the snake and the ladder.

## Ideation Sketch
Before creating the code for the game, I sketched out the different components the game will require based on the mechanics of the game. This helped me ideate which parts of the game will need a functional aspect priority to create a work flow and what elements will I need to create the game visually appealing with the help of CSS. 

## Game Architecture
To conceptualize the game, I reviewed the game structure and its variables required to create the basic game structure. My next step was to understand the basic functions required to play the game and pseudocode them. After these, I created my version with a the variation I wanted to add to the basic game structure.

## Approach to Development
With the help of 'Ideation Sketch' and 'Game Architecture' I broke down the project into stages:

* [x] Step 1: Generate the Game Board
* [x] Step 2: Create the Dice and it's Roll
* [x] Step 3: Generate the Player's moves based on the dice roll and vice or virtues by Snakes and Ladders
* [x] step 4: Create the snakes and ladders conditionally on the board

When I was coding out the project, I made it a habit to comment on my codes frequently as a practice. This helped me to get a clear picture of my structure and access my codes easily. This also meant that I also committed to GitHub frequently to log all of the changes to the project so I can retrieve an older version if necessary.

## Summary
Applying the knowledge of JS along with CSS and HTML to create a game from scratch as my first project was intriguing. Doing this on my own helped me revisit the concepts and undertsand the various ways of application, doing the right research and to pay attention to details. It also allowed me to appreciate different ways to approach problem solving at each step.

I learn best by reading resources on the topic and approaching to code with experiments based on my understanding. I look at reaching the solution within the timeline by constructing together the wins from these experiments and forming my own original approach of code. 
I believe "You got what it takes", where the skills and persisitence can definately get you to achieve the goal you need to reach.
